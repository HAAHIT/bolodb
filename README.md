# BoloDB

[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/BoloDB/bolodb/master.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/BoloDB/bolodb/master)

**Ask your data. Trust the answer.**

A text-to-SQL product for non-technical users. Connect any SQL database, ask
questions in plain English, get answers with a plain-English explanation and a
confidence level. Every answer you confirm teaches it your database — accuracy
improves with use.

**📚 Full documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md)** — written for
non-technical readers, with code pointers for developers at every step.

## Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest and recommended way to run BoloDB is using Docker. This ensures all services (FastAPI Backend, SvelteKit Frontend, and Nginx) run seamlessly.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux).
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required secrets.
4. Start the application:

   **Production / Coolify preview** (static frontend baked into nginx):
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

   **Local development** (Vite HMR):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (nginx) or [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) (Vite).

5. Set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file, connect a database (or click "Try with sample data"), and start asking!

## The AI engine

BoloDB uses **OpenRouter** (specifically the `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` model) for all AI operations. You only need one thing:
an OpenRouter API key.

1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys.
2. Click **Create Key** and copy it.
3. Set it as the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable for your deployment.

| Model | Best for |
|---|---|
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (default) | Best cost/accuracy balance for most uses |

**Privacy:** what's sent to the AI to generate SQL is your question plus the
context BoloDB builds around it: the database *structure* (table/column names,
keys), a few sample values and sample rows per table, your confirmed
business-term glossary, previously verified question→SQL examples, and the
last couple of conversation turns. **The prompt never includes** bulk table
contents, query results, or credentials — the OpenRouter API key travels only in
the request's authentication header. See
[docs/03-the-ai-layer-openrouter.md](docs/03-the-ai-layer-openrouter.md) for exactly
what's in every prompt.

## Database connection strings

| Database | Format |
|---|---|
| SQLite | `sqlite:///C:/path/to/file.db` |
| PostgreSQL | `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname` |
| MySQL | `mysql+pymysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname` |
| SQL Server | `mssql+pyodbc://user:pass@server/db?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server` |

Tip: connect with a **read-only database account** for safety (BoloDB also
enforces read-only itself — see
[docs/05-safety-validation-and-self-repair.md](docs/05-safety-validation-and-self-repair.md)).

## How it works

1. **Connect** a database and ensure your OpenRouter API key is set in the environment.
2. **Onboard** (first time) — BoloDB profiles the tables, confirms business-term meanings with you, and runs a few starter questions for you to verify
3. **Ask** questions in plain English. Every answer includes:
   - A plain-English restatement ("I summed completed orders for this month")
   - A confidence level (High/Medium/Low) based on real signals
   - The results table and SQL on a toggle
   - Automatic self-repair: generated SQL is validated against your schema and fixed before you ever see an error
4. **Verify** — click "Yes, correct" to save the answer. Similar future questions reuse it and show higher confidence. The trust level climbs from Supervised to Assisted to Trusted

## Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# Production / Coolify
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down

# Local development (Vite HMR)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
pytest tests
```

The test suite needs no network and no API key — all AI calls are faked.

## Privacy

- All learned knowledge and user settings are stored locally (`~/.bolodb/`) and in the local MongoDB container volume. The API key is read from the environment and never stored on disk.
- To generate SQL, the AI is sent your question plus context: the schema, a few sample values/rows per table, your confirmed glossary terms, verified question→SQL examples, and recent conversation turns. The prompt never includes bulk table data, query results, or credentials (the API key is used only as the request's authentication header).
- Queries run strictly read-only.
- No telemetry, no cloud sync.
