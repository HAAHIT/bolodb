"""Tests for run_query_stream (backend/app/controllers/query.py) — the SSE
streaming variant of the question→answer pipeline. Reuses the fake DB /
knowledge base / provider from test_query_pipeline.

Regression guard: run_query_stream once called model_budget() with two
positional arguments while it only accepts one, so every streamed query blew
up with a TypeError that surfaced to users as "An internal error occurred".
